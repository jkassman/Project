Zones: Difficulty and reward DOUBLES each zone
Currently Zones 0-5 ONLY.
Player's upgradeAtt() and updateStats() are affected. So you gain more during
	the upgrade phase and lose more if you fail an encounter.
You gain a base stat of 10-15 points in upgradeAtt() in 3-5 stages.
	-can be split across multiple attributes
You lose a base stat of 13-16 points in updateStats() if you fail an encounter.
	-the attribute corresponding to the trait you chose.
You gain + 2^zone in the trait you chose and -2^zone in the corresponding trait
	if you win
Encounter's challenge: Alien trait is multiplied by 2^zone without actually
	changing the alien's stored trait.
Alien incrTrait(): Aliens get 6-10 traits (like 3-5 player attributes).
	-about a third how fast the player naturally progresses.

TO-DO:
Only go forwards and backwards one zone, unlock somehow?
Unlock a new Alien each zone

Proposal: Logbook.
You have an entry for each encounter. A rob would say something like
"You get invaded by tiny craft built to duck through shields. As usual, blasting
the mothership away will force them to retreat. Also, speeding away should work,
provided your engines are good enough. However, there's no time to cleverly
navigate way. You can't bargain with or trick them once they've boarded, and
they will laugh in your face no matter how bold you appear. You can cautiously 
lay traps for the invaders to discourage them and send them back."

In the future, we could even have it so you unlock the logbook a little bit at a
time. Like if you lose with trick or diplomacy that line is unlocked. Also maybe
if you hear a story, a random line in the logbook is unlocked. Stuff like that.
