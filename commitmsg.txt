Finished incrTrait function in alien.cpp
Polished display trait function in alien.cpp
Moved the loop in upgradeAtt to main.cpp


To do:
Add quit option during encounter
Have displayResult depend on encounter type.
Change text after training to hide numbers.
Balance trait growth: player gets stronger much faster than aliens
