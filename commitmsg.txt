Fixed quit.
Always does 1-6 training sessions before encounter
Negative starting player traits
Added Golem, Star Runner, Scribe, Smuggler

To do:
Add quit option during encounter
Have displayResult depend on encounter type.
Change text after training to hide numbers.
Balance trait growth: player gets stronger much faster than aliens
