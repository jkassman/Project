THIS IS HARD MODE
In incrTrait,
increases much more with high hostility
increases random stats a random number of times


To do:
Add quit option during encounter
Have displayResult depend on encounter type.
Change text after training to hide numbers.
Balance trait growth: player gets stronger much faster than aliens
