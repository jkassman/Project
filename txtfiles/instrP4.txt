Zones:

The galaxy is divided into three zones. Zone 1, where your journey begins, is the core of civilization, and the citizens of that zone are relatively friendly. Higher numbered zones become less and less civilized, and you will encounter aliens that are more dangerous, harder to deal with, and more wary of tricks in these outer zones. Not only does this cause encounters to become more difficult to win, but also, when you lose an encounter, your attributes decrease an even greater amount. However, in the higher zones, you have more time alone between encounters, so your attributes rise much more significantly. 

It takes a great amount of preparation to travel to a new zone. You must learn about the way to travel there and the challenges you can expect to face. The best way to gain this information is by listening to stories from Scribes and Sky Runners, who know much about these topics. Also, to travel to a new zone, you will need upgraded parts for your ship to handle the rougher areas. To get the upgrades, you must successfully trade with Scribes and Smugglers. Once you have collected enough parts and learned enough information in a zone, you need to test your equipment in a friendly race. If you win, the next zone becomes unlocked.

You can change zones immediately after an encounter.  You should only move up zones when you are confident you will be able to face the challenges ahead. You must enter cryosleep to travel from zone to zone. It's dangerous to come out of cryosleep just after a warp, so the ship's computer only wakes you up when it senses an outside presence. Therefore, you immediately enter an encounter when you reach a new zone. When you reach Stellarim, Zone 3, you must survive there for a while to become comfortable in your new home. When you win enough encounters in Stellarim, you win the game.
