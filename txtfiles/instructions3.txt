Different things happen when you succeed or fail an encounter. If you succeed in the encounter, the trait you used to win becomes stronger, and its corresponding trait becomes weaker. Also, your bravery increases slightly, and your caution decreases slightly. The alien you encountered gets more difficult to defeat with the same trait. The aliens of this galaxy learn from their mistakes and grow in knowledge and power quickly. If you fail an encounter, the attribute corresponding to the trait you used falls considerably, your caution increases slightly, and your bravery decreases slightly. Finally, an alien you encounter might become more or less hostile towards you, depending on the type of encounter, the trait you used, and the outcome.

Here is an example encounter: A Scribe is trying to trade with you! You choose to try to trick the Scribe. You succeed, so your trickery increases, your diplomacy decreases, your bravery increases very slightly, your caution decreases very slightly, the Scribe becomes harder to trick in the future, and it becomes less hostile towards you because you made it think it made a good deal. If you had failed the encounter, then your intelligence would greatly decrease, your caution would increase slightly, your bravery would decrease slightly, and the Scribe would become more hostile towards you because it figured out your trick.
