I thought it might be a good idea to split up the work by having various jobs.
Here are the basics that I came up with (Please, please add/remove/insult
anything you don't like)

If you finish one job, take another!
ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY JOBS:
(These have to be done to make the game fun)

Balancer: As far as I can tell, we want a game where you should be able
to do well if you know lots about the aliens. Spamming one trait shouldn't work,
and various strategies should work, like a hostile path and a peaceful path.
(Maybe hostile things are easier to win but make the game more difficult in the
long run? YOU DECIDE, BALANCER). Hostility probably has too much of an impact
now, and there's no win/lose state.
1-2 person job

MAKE THE GAME MORE AWESOME JOBS
(Not all of these have to be done. If one job gets no love, that's fine)

LoreMaster: (or message Master). There are lots of different cases that
can occur, and if each of them had nice text to go with them that could make
the game stand out. Like instead of "You shouldn't use caution during a fight"
"You cautiously approach the laser beams. They still cut through your ship."
Play through the game and add a message wherever you think there should be one.

NOTES: Maybe don't actually add the message to the game, just make note of
exactly what case it would occur under. (For example, the above is if the user
chose caution during any fight encounter)

Panel-Engineer: Design the main game panel! Run the design past everybody first.

Inventor: Whatever feature you want, just go and add it. Want to play a minigame
every fight? Every time you fix the engines? DO IT. Run the idea/schematic by
everyone then get started.

^this structure might be too general, too specific, whatever. If you think this
whole thing is rubbish, let me know and we'll forget about it. I promise you
won't hurt my feelings.
