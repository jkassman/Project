Stellarim is the story of your quest to find freedom from the oppression of your past. You have stolen a starship and are fleeing through the galaxy. Your enemies are hunting you, but you might be able to get help from some of the alien species in the universe. However, these species might become additional enemies just as easily, depending on how you deal with them. Your goal is to reach Stellarim, a section of the galaxy so far away from civilization that you might just be able to find refuge from those who seek to destroy you. In this galaxy, you must grow as strong as possible without making too many others afraid of you. You must move quickly through the zones while gathering resources and power. You must reach Stellarim alive.

Traits and Attributes:

There are eight traits that describe the status of your ship and yourself. Each trait has a corresponding trait, and each of these pairs is tied to an attribute. Raising one trait lowers the corresponding trait, but raising an attribute raises both of its traits. For example, Trickery and Diplomacy are corresponding traits, and their attribute is Intelligence. So whenever your Trickery skills increase, your Diplomacy skills decrease, and vice versa. However, if you increase your Intelligence, both Trickery and Diplomacy are increased as well. The chart below shows all traits and attributes:

ATTRIBUTES:	[1] POWER	[2] ENGINES	[3] INTELLIGENCE	[4] SANITY

TRAITS:		[1] Lasers	[3] Speed	[5] Trickery		[7] Bravery
