Encounters:

Your interactions with other alien species are defined by events called encounters. There are many different encounters, and many different aliens to encounter. During each encounter, you have the option of responding with any of the eight traits. However, only certain traits are effective in a given type of encounter. For example, diplomacy is useless when you are in a fight. Different aliens respond differently to your choice of trait in different encounters. A Scribe is much harder to trick than a Smuggler when you are trying to trade with one of them. Careful planning is necessary to make encounters go your way.

Different things happen when you succeed or fail an encounter. If you succeed in the encounter, the trait you used to win becomes stronger, and its corresponding trait becomes weaker. Also, your bravery increases slightly, and your caution decreases slightly. The alien you encountered gets more difficult to defeat with the same trait. If you fail an encounter, the attribute corresponding to the trait you used falls considerably, your caution increases slightly, and your bravery decreases slightly. Finally, an alien you encounter might become more or less hostile towards you, depending on the type of encounter, the trait you used, and the outcome.

Here is an example encounter: A Scribe is trying to trade with you! You choose to try to trick the Scribe. You succeed, so your trickery increases, your diplomacy decreases, your bravery increases, your caution decreases, the Scribe becomes harder to trick in the future, and it becomes less hostile towards you because you made it think it made a good deal. If you had failed the encounter, then your intelligence would greatly decrease, your caution would increase slightly, your bravery would decrease slightly, and the Scribe would become more hostile towards you because it figured out your trick.
