You can change zones immediately after an encounter.  You should only move up zones when you are confident you will be able to face the challenges ahead. You must enter cryosleep to travel from zone to zone. It's dangerous to come out of cryosleep just after a warp, so the ship's computer only wakes you up when it senses an outside presence. Therefore, you immediately enter an encounter when you reach a new zone. When you reach Stellarim, Zone 5, you must survive there for a while to become comfortable in your new home. When you win enough encounters in Stellarim, you win the game.
