Stellarim is the story of your quest to find freedom from the oppression of your past. You have stolen a starship and are fleeing through the galaxy. Your enemies are hunting you, but you might be able to get help from some of the alien species in the universe. However, these species might become additional enemies just as easily, depending on how you deal with them. Your goal is to reach Stellarim, a section of the galaxy so far away from civilization that you might just be able to find refuge from those who seek to destroy you. In this galaxy, you must grow as strong as possible without making too many others afraid of you. You must move quickly through the zones while gathering resources and power. You must reach Stellarim alive.
