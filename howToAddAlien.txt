To make a new alien:
1. Copy and rename Dragon.cpp and Dragon.h
2. Replace dragon in each with new alien name (Don't forget ifndef)
3. Change starting traits. Sum = 50. Remember higher number means stronger against the trait. So golem has high laser because it is tough to kill, and low trickery because it is easy to trick.
4. Change encounters in constructor (value of array spot and comment)
5. Include .h and instantiate class in main
6. Increase random number, add case with pointer
7. Add to objects list in makefile
