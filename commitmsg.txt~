Changing display order to give all displayed text.
Began making incrTrait function for alien to increase difficulty (not complete yet)


To do:
Add quit option during encounter
Have displayResult depend on encounter type.
Change text after training to hide numbers.
Balance trait growth: player gets stronger much faster than aliens
Finish incrTrait function in alien.cpp
