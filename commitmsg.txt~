Looked over work done by others previously
Fixed text spacing in Energy training
Fixed update stats text spacing after successful encounter
When upgrading attributes, now changes input to uppercase
Fixed: Bug: Seems to always lose bravery challenge
debug mode added. When training or encountering, enter ? to dislay stats
Fixed: Garbage values for alien stats (removed dragon.cpp traits vector)
Player and alien traits: 1-8 player attr: 0-3
Now correctly adds attribute to trait before challenge


To do:
Fix quit
change number of turns till encounter to have max value
add other races
